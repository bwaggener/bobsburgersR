# Data Dictionary

## `imdb_wikipedia_data`

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `episode_overall` | `dbl` | The overall episode number in the entire Bob's Burgers series (starting from episode 1). |
| `imdb_aired_date` | `date` | The date the episode originally aired, according to IMDb. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. |
| `year` | `dbl` | The year the episode aired. |
| `season` | `dbl` | The season number of the episode within the Bob's Burgers TV show. |
| `episode` | `dbl` | The episode number within the specific season of the Bob's Burgers TV show. |
| `imdb_title` | `chr` | The title of the episode, as listed on IMDb. |
| `rating` | `dbl` | The IMDb user rating of the episode (on a scale from 1 to 10). |
| `synopsis` | `chr` | A brief description or synopsis of the episode, summarizing the key plot points, according to IMDb. |
| `wikipedia_directed_by` | `chr` | The name(s) of the director(s) of the episode, as listed on Wikipedia. |
| `wikipedia_written_by` | `chr` | The name(s) of the writer(s) of the episode, as listed on Wikipedia. |
| `wikipedia_viewers` | `dbl` | The number of US viewers (in millions) who watched the episode when it first aired, according to Wikipedia. |

### Notes:

-   **IMDb vs. Wikipedia**: `imdb_aired_date`, `imdb_title`, `rating`, and `synopsis` are from IMDb, while `wikipedia_directed_by`, `wikipedia_written_by`, and `wikipedia_viewers` are from Wikipedia. Both sources provide complementary data for the same episodes.

-   Viewer numbers (`wikipedia_viewers`) represent the viewership in millions, so 9.38 means 9.38 million viewers.

## `transcript_data`

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `season` | `dbl` | The season number in which the episode is part of the Bob's Burgers TV show. |
| `episode` | `dbl` | The episode number within the specific season of Bob's Burgers. |
| `title` | `chr` | The title of the episode in which the dialogue line appears. |
| `line` | `dbl` | The line number of the dialogue in the episode (the order in which it appears). |
| `raw_text` | `chr` | The original raw text of the dialogue, possibly including formatting or special characters. |
| `dialogue` | `chr` | Cleaned-up version of the `raw_text`, containing the actual dialogue spoken by the characters in the episode. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Notes:

-   The `raw_text` column contains the unprocessed version of the dialogue, while `dialogue` is the cleaned-up version.

# Examples

## IMDb Ratings by Season

This plot shows the distribution of IMDb ratings for each season, with individual episode ratings represented as jittered points.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
data("imdb_wikipedia_data")
head(imdb_wikipedia_data)

# Box Plot with Jitter: IMDb Ratings by Season

ggplot(imdb_wikipedia_data, aes(x = as.factor(season), y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black", outlier.shape = NA) + # Avoid duplicate points by not showing boxplot outliers
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkred", position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.2)) +
  labs(
    title = "IMDb Ratings by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Heatmap: Lines Spoken by Season and Episode

The following heatmap shows the number of dialogue lines spoken in each episode across different seasons of Bob's Burgers.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data("transcript_data")
head(transcript_data)

## Heatmap: Lines Spoken by Season and Episode

# Summarize number of lines per episode per season
heatmap_data <- transcript_data |>
  filter(!is.na(dialogue)) |>  
  group_by(season, episode) |>
  summarize(total_lines = n(), .groups = "drop") 

# Heatmap: Lines Spoken by Season and Episode
ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = as.factor(episode), y = as.factor(season), fill = total_lines)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightyellow", high = "red") +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(
    title = "Lines Spoken by Season and Episode",
    x = "Episode",
    y = "Season",
    fill = "Total Lines"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
